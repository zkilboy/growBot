growBot v0.0.1
5/2/21
Initial commit

Purpose:
growBot is meant to be a full service automated eco-system for houseplants. In 
the first build I intend to gather local weather data from the internet to 
determine sunrise and sunset times. growBot will use this data to trigger a 
relay to power a grow light.
Following intial grow light power control I intend to use a stepper motor and a 
few micro-switches to have the grow light travel the length of the container 
over the course of the sunrise-sunset timeframe.
Eventually I intend to add irrigation and airflow controls also syncrhonized to 
local weather data.
Given that local weather conditions may not always be hospitable to the plants, 
I also intend to create optimized conditions for various climates, and the 
ability to add custom parameters in a separate config file.

In addition to providing my code, I will also make drawings of any physical 
components (i.e. 3D printed parts, wooden structure, wiring diagrams, etc.).

Raspberry Pi is not  capable of running a stepper motor without a hat. I thought
I could make something work with the electronics on hand, but I think it will be
significantly easier to run an Arduino and RAMPS v1.4 that I have from a 
previous project. I will reduce and simplify this later, but I would like to get
this project functional. I will include the C++ source used on the Arduino as 
well.
